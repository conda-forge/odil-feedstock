    - Reading and writing data sets with any transfer syntax
    - Standard JSON and XML representation of datasets
    - Clients and servers for the various DICOM protocols (C-FIND, C-GET, C-MOVE, C-STORE)
    - Implementation of the DICOM web-services (WADO-RS, QIDO-RS, STOW-RS)
    - Conversion to and from DCMTK data structures.
